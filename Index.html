I'm a Physiotherapy student of UNEC with a passion for technology and a adrive to learn and grow. I've always been fascinated by the way things work, and enjoy figuring out how to make them work better. Basketball has always been a part of my life, and I love the way it challanges me both physically and mentally.</p><br>
<br><p>I enjoy reading up on the latest technology trends and finding ways to apply them to real-world problems. I'm currently learning Front end development at Atueyi Coding Academy and it has been awesome. The environment is very conducive and our teacher is top notch. I'm dedicated to learning and developing my skills, and I'm always looking for new opportunities to grow.</p>
